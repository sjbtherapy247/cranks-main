IMPORT INSTRUCTIONS
===========================================

STEP 1: Import Categories First
-------------------------------
1. Go to Ecwid Control Panel → Catalog → Categories
2. Click Import (or use bulk actions)
3. Upload: ecwid-categories.csv
4. This creates your category hierarchy

STEP 2: Import Products
-----------------------
1. Go to Ecwid Control Panel → Catalog → Products
2. Click Import
3. Upload: ecwid-products.csv
4. Map columns to Ecwid fields
5. ✅ ENABLE "Download images from URLs"
6. Run import

STEP 3: Set Up Redirects (for SEO)
----------------------------------
For Vercel (recommended):
  1. Copy contents of redirects.json
  2. Add to your vercel.json file

For Next.js:
  1. Copy contents of redirects-nextjs.txt
  2. Add to next.config.mjs

For Nginx:
  1. Copy contents of redirects-nginx.conf
  2. Add to your nginx server block

For Apache:
  1. Copy contents of redirects-htaccess.txt
  2. Add to your .htaccess file

STEP 4: Verify
--------------
1. Check products have correct categories
2. Verify images downloaded properly
3. Test redirects work (old URLs → new URLs)
4. Submit updated sitemap to Google Search Console

Notes:
- Categories use "/" as path separator (e.g., "Bikes/Mountain Bikes/Hardtail")
- Edit CATEGORY_CORRECTIONS in the script to fix typos
- Review redirects-review.csv to verify redirect mappings
- Set PRESERVE_CATEGORY_HIERARCHY = false to collapse to top-level only
